# Predicting Car Prices
by Nicholas Archambault

This project predicts car prices based on a variety of technical characteristics, including engine size, fuel efficiency, and horsepower. Using the k-nearest neighbors algorithm with varying k-values and feature combinations allows for visualization and understanding of what makes an effective and accurate KNN model.

## Goals
1. Prepare dataset for machine learning applications with rigorous cleaning process.
2. Initiate and gauge the comparative results of univariate and multivariate k-nearest neighbors models in order to understand which features most accurately predict car price.
3. Modify k-values and tune hyperparameters to achieve more accurate predictions.
4. Plot results to visualize the benefits and compromises of k-nearest neighbors testing. 

## Output
Analysis of the success of univariate, multivariate, and hyperparameter-tuned k-nearest neighbors models and how mean squared error changes with different model attributes.
